**Introduction**
![Project Image](images/Screenshot%20(18).png)
- The project enbales users to find their needed product on the E-commerce site. Ernest Thankson and myself decided to do this to help customers find their products and merchants also to upload their products online and a lot more.

**Why we choose this project**
- My team chose this project because we are in a digital world and since products and other business are done digitally, we put it on ourselves to build a user-friendly ecommerce site to help mankind. Also with Ernest Thankson being a senior software developer, he brought the idea so that we all can build it.

**Accomplishment with our project**

- For the frontend, we used html, bootstrap, javascript, jquery to structure how the frontend would be like whilst PHP and mysql was used to structure the backend

- - Features completed
- - - PHP smtp for email and google two step verification
- - - The app is responsive and compatible with various screen sizes

**Most difficult Technical challenge**
- The most difficult situation that we were able to conquer was configuring the PHP smtp mail for login systems.After writng the backend for the new user to able to do verification on his or her mail, the mail was not working perfectly due to new version of PHP that was released so there was this conflict between the old and new. In solving this problem or task, we had to uninstall apache, reinstalled it and configure it by starting the apache server. So after multiple trials, we were able to configure it using an example from stackoverflow. It was really a tough project but it was worth if after it was configured.

**Lessons Learnt**
- This project made us do a lot of research concerning how to configure the PHP smtp mail. As an engineer, I learnt that problem solving, research and continous learning is a great pathway to achieving a lot in this tech world. It has also made me understand that, with consistency and thorough practice, we can achieve greater things.
